        <p>Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Camille Frazier, and I’m an artist for my page Sweet Donuts Art. I am known on my social media as heavens-angel96 (or heavens_angel96 as well), and I wanted to create a website where I could show the natural progression of my art skills!</p>

        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p>I am an IT student at Mizzou and will graduate in the fall 2019 semester. Despite my technical background, I have loved art since I was little and always wanted to draw to improve my skills. I haven’t drawn since high school, so it might take me a while, but having a website where I can get feedback will help for me to improve overall a lot!</p>

        <h2>Why I Created This Website</h2>
        <p>I created this website to fulfill three goals:
        <ol>
            <li>To update family and friends on my art progress</li>
            <li>To introduce new followers to my work and gain a following</li>
            <li>To present works to potential commissioners/art recruiters</li>
        </ol>
            I might not be world recognized, but I at least want to present my art to the world as something that I have accomplished.
        <p/>

        <p>Thank you for visiting my page and I hope that you enjoy your stay!</p>
