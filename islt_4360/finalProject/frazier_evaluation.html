            <p>I gave these evaluations to my close friends in order to get some feedback from them. Only two were able to respond to me in time, however, so I will be going off of feedback that I was given from the both of them. Both had said very good things about hte website, from the design to the layout, to the way that the pictures loaded. One major concern that was brought up between both of my evaluators, however, was the lack of more content on my website, specifically videos. I placed the bare minimum on my site to see if it would even work and how to utilize the layout, and both of my evaluators brought up that the lack of such features brought down how the website could be enjoyed. Other than the inconvenience with content, they also made smaller suggestions on how I could utilize a better layout for my photos or adjusting the way that captions are read.</p>

            <h2>Participants</h2>
            <p>Brittany works in the field of psychology. Because of this, she has knowledge in how research has been done on how people react to certain colors and feelings in mood. She is also an avid social media user and is well versed in ways that social media can affect the moods of others and how people interact with each other. <a href="Brittany_evaluation.docx">Brittany's Evaluation Form</a></p>
            <p>Asante is also a constant user of technology and social media in his daily life as well. He has a biology degree, and while it may be harder to coordinate with the use of technology, he is a person that is sensitive to the moods and thoughts of others, whether online or in person. His relation to the STEM field gives him a perspective from a scientific point of view how people can use social media to advance as a society overall. <a href="Tay_evaluation.docx">Asante's Evaluation Form</a></p>

            <h2>Ranking</h2>
            <p>Most of the rankings I received were top rankings. However, the parts that were ranked lower depended on what was in the website itself. The categories that had lower rankings were in video and media usage, and this was because at the time, there was a limited amount of media that was available on the website. Because of this, it could not be evaluated properly, and received lower marks. </p>

            <h2>Use Cases</h2>
            <p>These evaluations fit the use cases I created because my friends are one of the top use cases that I created. I wanted to make something tha family and friends could enjoy and look at my art all in one place, and although there was not much on the website to offer, there was enough that my friends could enjoy looking around and giving me feedback on what I could improve. Brittany had liked the aspect of being able to open an email whn submitting a form to contact me. Asante liked the fact that my color scheme was bright yet still readable.  I feel that aspects such as forms and submitting emails directly in a mail popup would be very useful for people that are looking to contact me for commissions or recruiting, since any messages would go directly to my inbox. Also, I find that the color scheme would help to attract new people onnto my website that have not heard of me and wish to view more of my art in a less cluttered setting. </p>

            <h2>Recommended Changes</h2>
            <p>The things that were recommended were to add more media, especially videos, to my website. There was also a suggestion to edit the layout of the captions to my pieces, such as adding them to the bottom of each photo instead of to the side. Other than tightening up the layout and adding more content, there was not much else that was suggested, so I will be adding to what happens as I code the website as needed.</p>

            <h2>Reflections</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, going through the evaluation process has been an interesting one. Not only was I able to see my website used in real time, I was also able to determine what areas are strong vs. what I needed to work on. Getting feedback from people I trusted  made the advice feel more personal, since it was a set of fresh eyes on a website that I had only previewed a few times in between coding. Overall, it seemed that the design of the website itself was quite strong, it was mostly just that some of my main features had not been implemented into the full webite yet. This information had helped me determine what types of aspects that I should focus on when building websites and that putting content on the website is a necessity if I want others to return to and review my website.</p>
