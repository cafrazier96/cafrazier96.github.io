        <h1>Camille Frazier's Basic Webpage</h1>
        <p>Hello! This is my very basic webpage, where I learn more about website tags and post upcoming information about my final project. Feel free to look around!</p>
        
        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi! I'm Camille, and I have loved to draw from an early age. I used to do art classes in high school, however, I had to stop a little bit before college in order to focus on my major, which is in engineering. Due to rigorous classes, I never had time to do anything creative. However, I ended up starting to slowly draw again over the years, and found myself getting an iPad, and drawing on it starting in June of 2019. I fell in love with art again, and even though I am still rusty after over 5 years of not doing art, it is still fun to do and creating and posting online is a way for me to be able to put myself out there and hopfully inspire others to do the same.</p>
        <p>A quote that I find very inspiring from Michelle Obama is:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=790hG6qBPx0">The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. </blockquote>
        
        <h3>My Goals and My Instagram</h3>
        <p>There are a few basic things that I want to accomplish with my project. Because my project will be sort of an art portfolio, I want to try to make it look as nice as possible and have some basic features to add as a result. Here are some basic features I want to add:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A navigation bar at the top of the screen along with a possible search bar</li>
            <li>A slide gallery at the front page to show my favorite featured pieces</li>
            <li>A way to display images in a format that is flattering to the original image while not hopefully losing quality</li>
            <li>Embedded videos for my timelapse art videos</li>
            <li>Blog-style posts to keep whoever is looking at the site updated on what is happening in my life and with my art</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I hope to add all of these features, at least as a prototype in case if I ever need an actual website, but if I could get at least 2 of these features to work the way that I want them too, then I would be very happy with how the final result looks. A similar way to display art and images are many sites such as Instagram, Tumblr, and even personal artists' websites, where they sell their work. I'm not interested in selling my work at this time, but if I could find a way to integrate it into the webpage, then that would be an interesting project for future reference.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you for looking at this webpage, and please look forward to more updates on this project! <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sweetdonuts.art/">Check out my Instagram!</a></p>
