        <h1>Camille Frazier's Design Document</h1>
        <p>This is a proposed plan for the final website project of an art portfolio. This is not the final product of what will all be on the site, but will be a very good guideline for me to get started in the design process.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <h3>The purpose of this website is to create an art portfolio in order to display my artworks, as well as create a centralized area where others can view my work in a specific place. Users can look at pictures, view videos, and see blog posts that I post on it and be able to get to know me as an artist, as well as watch my improvement. By doing so, I could potentially gain a following and possibly show my art to a wider audience.</h3>
        
        
        <h2>Use Case</h2>
        <p>Case 1:  to bring new potential followers of my art

User: visitor that is curious to know more about my work

Basic Flow: mentioning my website on other pages where I post can point new traffic to a catch-all place to view and interact with my artwork. This could help me to gain new followers that I haven’t interacted with and give them a more personal side to what I post on social media.
</p>
        <p>Case 2: to entertain and have a place to view all of my artwork in one place

User: friends and family

Basic Flow: friends and family that know of my art can see it all in one place. Instead of social media, where it would be hidden in many posts and under other events, my friends and family could view my artworks in one singular place without external distractions. It is also a way to view the progression of skill in my art that might not be noticed until it's all in one place.
</p>
        <p>Case 3: to present to others in a more professional way

User: potential art scouters/recruiters/commissioners

Basic Flow: creating business cards that have my website or posting it on websites such as LinkedIn not only gives it new traffic to view artwork but can also help me to network with others that contact me who are interested in my work and would like to use my artistic skills for outside projects.

        <h2>Design Concept</h2>
        <h3>Target Audience</h3>
        <p>My target audience is my friends and family for the most part, since I know that they would interact with the website the most and it would be kind of a prototype for my personal portfolio. However, if I wanted to expand my audience, the target audience would be any followers that are on my social media pages. These demographics can vary since most social media audiences come from all over the world, but my main audience includes:</p>

However, if I wanted to expand my audience, the target audience would be any followers that are on my social media pages. These demographics can vary since most social media audiences come from all over the world, but my main audience includes:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>anyone interested in art and art processes</li>
            <li>other artists interested in my work</li>
            <li>agents looking to view new artists</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Reference Websites</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.genevab.com/">GDBee Art</a> <strong>(Geneva Bowers)</strong> – A self-taught illustrator that is popular on Instagram. What I like about her website is that it is very clean, has very organized pages, and that her nav bar is a different color, making it easier to find. Her different types of artwork that she does is very organized into different categories so that others may find different types of her work that she has done for different projects. </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.udamakka.com">Umaima's Art</a> <strong>(Umaima Damakkah, known as coloured_braids on Instagram)</strong> - a 2D animator, as well as a character designer and illustrator. I like her website because it is very clean and simple. I like that the website has a few pages that have slideshows of the works, and a page of a couple of videos. However, this is also what i dislike about the website as a viewer, because I would rather scroll than have to click most of the artworks in a slideshow. I do, however, like that fact that the thumbnails on the side, but considering that this would take a bit of Flash to do and we can't really use Javascript, it is not very useful to me. The videos page does have scrolling because the storyboards are there as well as explanations of them. I also like the external link to her resume is alongside her about paragraph. </li>
            <li><a href="http://asieybarbie.com/">Asiey Barbie</a> <strong>(Asia Kendrick-Horton)</strong> - a self-taught illustrator. The colors and layout of the home page are really nice, and have a column style layout that is really nice to look at. The forms are very nicely laid out and very detailed, and I like the fact that there is an option to upload files as well. Everything is laid out well and easy to navigate. </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.lkrecic.com/">Leanne Krecic</a> <strong>(Leanne Krecic)</strong> - known as a popular webcomic artist. I like the professional look of the website, it is very modern and the transitions are nice. There are only a few pages, as the artist mostly wants to focus on those other works that she has done as well as anything related to her webcomic on a different app. However, there is a lot of Flash used, and it occasionally slows down the load times of artwork and one of the pages. </li>
            <li><a href="http://www.ashleymichellesimpson.com/">Ashley Michelle Simpson</a> <strong>(Ashley Michelle Simpson)</strong> - a professional animator who works for major studios such as Disney. Her website is also very simple but have quite a few pages at the top. The layout is pretty clean overall, and the images and videos are nice quality. However, the first time I loaded the website, a lot of the images took a long time to load (mostly because of her huge banner size taking up bandwidth) and I didn't like that a couple of behind the scenes style pages were onsidred separate when they could have been made into a dropdown menu. It was an ok site, but I think that it should think more about the bandwith of loading times for larger images, especially for people who have slower networks like mine. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Presentation Information</h2>
        <h3>Content Synopsis</h3>
        <p>I intend to present my art in a way that is easy to follow, maybe two or three columns on a page. I want to make sure that it isn’t too overwhelming on a person looking at the photographs and is easily accessible to others.</p>
        
        <h3>Text References/Pages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>About: This section is about me, why I made the website, how I got into art, and what I do outside of art</li>
            <li>Artwork: This has all my artwork on display in an image format on the pages. Users can either hover or click for more information about the pieces.</li>
            <li>Collections: These are themed art “collections” that have a similar style, theme, etc, in common, and are grouped as such. Useful for people that only want to see one aspect of my work instead of all of it at a time. Not everything is grouped into a theme, only certain works that were created with a theme in mind.</li>
            <li>Videos: Works of mine that were filmed in process would be uploaded here, such as speedpaints and technique works.</li>
            <li>Blog: a personal place to update visitors, fans, etc. on things that are happening in my life, whether art-related or not as much. If there are any non-artwork photos on the website, they would be in this category. May or may not include a comments section where others can post their thoughts on each blog.</li>
            <li>Contact: a place where someone could contact me about something or leave me a message so that I can respond to them later.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Wireframe</h3>
        <p>The wireframe was hand-drawn in an art software, so please excuse the messy handwriting.</p>
        <a href="wireframe.zip">Wireframe Doc</a>
        
        <h3>Rationale for Organization</h3>
        <p>I organized the website this way because I think that it will be the easiest to follow. Other websites that I have seen are either very minimal or too disorganized with no place to tell where to go from the home page. With my website, there is a clear distinction of where things are, the navigation will stay the same, and there will not be any page that is not logical and does not belong there.</p>
        
        <h3>Media</h3>
        <p>I will be placing my own media onto the website, which will consist of artworks/art related photos of mine as well as videos of processes of some of the artwork that I have done. If any of the videos will include any audio, it will be royalty free and commercially available. The medial is tagged with my handle/signature but will also have a copyright in the captions as well. Audio will be credited either in the video or in the caption of the video.</p>
        
        <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
       <p>I am having a hard time figuring out exactly what color scheme I want to use, since I really like colors on a website. However, I have decided that I want to be able to use either bright colors or a warm color scheme. In some of my responses, it was noted that bright and soft colors were more pleasing and had a happier effect on visiting patrons, and I though that a black/white would be too much of a stark contrast as a website. So, I will include either some bright pastels or some warm colors as my color scheme.</p>
